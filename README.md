The W.(UnemployablesUnited)

We've been tinkering in the lab with a proactive idea that we think will be for the benefit of the community. We thought it was such a great idea, that we wanted the community to get involved.

So here is the deal: 78.5MN people are currently unemployed in the US, according to Shadow Stats<http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/unemployment-charts>.

How grand would it be to Unite the Unemployables, in such a way that allows them to connect with each other, support each other, and collaborate on solving real world problems?

We've taken the concept and put it down on paper, we've even taken the time to create an Infographic which reveals some interesting results on the future of this new product offering.

We've also given some thought as to some ground rules about this open source project.

Rules:
0. NO RECRUITERS.
1. UNEMPLOYED Persons ONLY
2. No discussion about Politics, Religion, Opinions.
3. NO COMMERCIALIZATION! That's means, if we find out that you've taken this idea
    And try to extort money from the Unemployables, we will pursue the proper channels and 
    You will be dealt with accordingly.
4. Feel free to decide on the tool set to make this a reality. There is no correct choice here. 
     If you're unable to decide on ONE, hell use them all! If development was started in Java, 
     And you like Ruby, then develop the tech ruby - You know the DEAL.
5. NO COMMERCIALIZATION! That's means, if we find out that you've taken this idea
     And try to extort money from the Unemployables, we will pursue the proper channels and 
     You will be dealt with accordingly.
6. No discussion about Politics, Religion, Opinions -> We aren't here for this sort of thing.
     Our idea of social justice, is making The W.(The Unemployables United) a Reality.
7. We encourage all UNEMPLOYED persons to contribute, regardless of technical
     experience or lack there of. Marketing, Product, Designers, Graphic Artists, Copy Writers
     - basically whoever and whatever you would like to work on.

This technology is far to powerful to be in the possession of the few, that is WHY We've decided to place it in the hands of the community. What happens next, is really up to THE COMMUNITY.

NOW - GO AND MAKE The W.(The Unemployables United) A REALITY, FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF HUMANITY & WORLD PEACE.
